## Programming Challenge

Your goal is to take the provided dataset `TitanicData.csv` and `TitanicData2.csv` and write a program **in R** that (1) reads the data from both CSVs, (2) merges the data sets together, and (3) munges that data such that you can (4) produce a glmnet model predicting the chance that a Titanic passanger survived.

You should also aim to extract some additional information from the `Name` variable.

## Variable Info

* `PassengerId` - the ID of the passenger.
* `Survived` - whether or not the passenger survived.  0 means died, 1 means survived.
* `PClass` - the class of the passenger.
* `Name` - the name of the passenger.
* `Sex` - the sex of the passenger. When not specified, 1 means female, 0 means male.
* `Age` - the age of the passenger.
* `fare` - The fare paid for the ticket.
* `embarked` - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
